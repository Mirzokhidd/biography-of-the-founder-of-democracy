            <p class="passageOne">Cleisthenes (/ˈklaɪsθɪˌniːz/; Greek: Κλεισθένης, Kleisthénēs) was an ancient Athenian lawgiver credited with reforming
                the constitution of ancient Athens and setting it on a democratic footing in 508 BC.For these accomplishments, 
                historians refer to him as "the father of Athenian democracy." He was a member of the aristocratic Alcmaeonid clan.
                He was the younger son of Megacles and Agariste making him the maternal grandson of the tyrant Cleisthenes of Sicyon. 
                He was also credited with increasing the power of the Athenian citizens' assembly and for reducing the power of the 
                nobility over Athenian politics</p>

                Rise to power

                With help from the Spartans and the Alcmaeonidae (Cleisthenes' genos, "clan"), he was responsible for 
                overthrowing Hippias, the tyrant son of Pisistratus. After the collapse of Hippias' tyranny, Isagoras and Cleisthenes were
                rivals for power, but Isagoras won the upper hand by appealing to the Spartan king Cleomenes I to help him expel Cleisthenes.
                He did so on the pretext of the Alcmaeonid curse. Consequently, Cleisthenes left Athens as an exile, and Isagoras was
                unrivalled in power within the city. Isagoras set about dispossessing hundreds of Athenians of their homes and exiling 
                them on the pretext that they too were cursed. He also attempted to dissolve the Boule (βουλή), a council of Athenian 
                citizens appointed to run the daily affairs of the city. However, the council resisted, and the Athenian people declared 
                their support of the council. Isagoras and his supporters were forced to flee to the Acropolis, remaining besieged there
                for two days. On the third day they fled the city and were banished. Cleisthenes was subsequently recalled, along with 
                hundreds of exiles, and he assumed leadership of Athens.

                Contribution to the governance of Athens

                After this victory, Cleisthenes began to reform the government of Athens. He commissioned a bronze memorial from the sculptor
                Antenor in honor of the lovers and tyrannicides Harmodius and Aristogeiton, whom Hippias had executed. In order to forestall 
                strife between the traditional clans, which had led to the tyranny in the first place, he changed the political organization
                from the four traditional tribes, which were based on family relations and which formed the basis of the upper class Athenian 
                political power network, into ten tribes according to their area of residence (their deme,) which would form the basis of a 
                new democratic power structure. It is thought that there may have been 139 demes (though this is still a matter of debate),
                each organized into three groups called trittyes ("thirds"), with ten demes divided among three regions in each trittyes 
                (a city region, asty; a coastal region, paralia; and an inland region, mesogeia). Cleisthenes also abolished patronymics
                in favour of demonymics (a name given according to the deme to which one belongs), thus increasing Athenians' sense of 
                belonging to a deme. He also established sortition - the random selection of citizens to fill government positions 
                rather than kinship or heredity, a true test of real democracy. He reorganized the Boule, created with 400 members under 
                Solon, so that it had 500 members, 50 from each tribe. He also introduced the bouletic oath, "To advise according to the 
                laws what was best for the people". The court system (Dikasteria — law courts) was reorganized and had from 201–5001 
                jurors selected each day, up to 500 from each tribe. It was the role of the Boule to propose laws to the assembly of voters, 
                who convened in Athens around forty times a year for this purpose. The bills proposed could be rejected, passed or returned 
                for amendments by the assembly.Cleisthenes also may have introduced ostracism (first used in 487 BC), whereby a vote by a
                plurality of citizens would exile a citizen for 10 years. The initial trend was to vote for a citizen deemed a threat to the
                democracy (e.g., by having ambitions to set himself up as tyrant). However, soon after, any citizen judged to have too much
                power in the city tended to be targeted for exile (e.g., Xanthippus in 485/84 BC). Under this system, the exiled man's
                property was maintained, but he was not physically in the city where he could possibly create a new tyranny. One later 
                ancient author records that Cleisthenes himself was the first person to be ostracized.Cleisthenes called these reforms 
                isonomia ("equality vis à vis law", iso-=equality; nomos=law), instead of demokratia. Cleisthenes' life after his reforms 
                is unknown as no ancient texts mention him thereafter.
